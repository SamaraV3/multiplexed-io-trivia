# Multiplexed I/O Trivia Game

Code for a class assignment involving the creation of a fully functional client-server trivia game using low-level systems programming in C. The server acted as the game host, broadcasting questions and managing players, while the client allowed individual users to connect, submit answers, and compete in real time.
